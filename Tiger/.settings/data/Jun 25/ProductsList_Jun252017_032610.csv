Apple Pay combines the convenience and security of Touch ID and Passbook with NFC technology. So you can use iPhone 6 to pay in stores and within apps with a single touch.Everything within reach.By creating iPhone 6 and iOS 8 together, we optimized the software to enhance the physical design. iOS swipe gestures were designed to be more fluid across the seamless form, making it easy to navigate iPhone with one hand. With new features like Reachability you can interact with the larger screen in different ways, too. Simply double touch the Home button and the entire screen shifts down closer to your thumb. And to easily navigate Safari or Mail, swipe left to right across the screen to go backward, or swipe right to left to go forward. With the new continuous surface of iPhone, all your gestures now feel smoother than ever.We also thought about how you use your iPhone every day and redesigned the buttons to make it even easier to use.

That’s also why it has more LTE bands than any other smartphone. iPhone 6 supports more advanced wireless technologies to boost performance and help you connect to the things and people that matter most.Higher contrastRather than using traditional methods to create the higher-resolution Retina HD display, we developed an advanced process of photo alignment. This involves using UV light to precisely position the display’s liquid crystals so they lie exactly where they should. Better-aligned crystals deliver a superior viewing experience, with deeper blacks and sharper text.An innovative seamless design.The first thing you notice when you hold iPhone 6 is how great it feels in your hand. The cover glass curves down around the sides to meet the anodized aluminum enclosure in a remarkable, simplified design. There are no distinct edges. No gaps. Just a smooth, seamless bond of metal and glass that feels like one continuous surface.The technology behind Touch ID.There’s a lot of technology at work below the surface of the Home button. Touch it and the surrounding stainless steel ring detects your finger and wakes the capacitive touch sensor. The laser-cut sapphire crystal surface of the button then directs the image of your finger to the sensor, which reads beneath the outer layers of your skin to get a detailed fingerprint. Software then reads the ridges of your fingerprint and finds the match to unlock your phone.","4.7-inch (diagonal) Retina HD display with 1334-by-750 resolution","A8 chip with M8 motion coprocessor","8-megapixel iSight camera with Focus Pixels and True Tone flash","1080p HD video recording at 60 fps and slo-mo video recording at 240 fps","FaceTime HD camera, Built-in rechargeable lithium-ion battery","http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41qcJFbvAJL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg","http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31XgfK4hfqL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg","http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VNhY14ffL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg","http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/215o4IcxDHL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg","NA","Electronics","Mobiles & Accessories","Smartphones & Basic Mobiles","Smartphones","NA",

You can capture panoramic shots and square pictures and even enhance your images with the help of multiple filters available in the phone. It is possible to zoom while recording a video and capture HD videos at the rate of 120 frames per second. Auto image stabilisation is another one of this iPhone’s benefits, which makes sure your images have less noise. This feature also does away with the blurring effect caused due to hand and camera shake.Advanced Security FeaturesThis smartphone has an exclusive fingerprint identity sensor called Touch ID, that can recognize the impression of your fingers when they are placed on the home button. This smartphone by Apple will only unlock when you place your finger on the sensor. This technology ensures that nobody else is able to use the device. In case you want anyone else to have access to the phone, you can easily save their fingerprints on it as well. It is also possible to save your fingerprint as the password for iTunes and Apple App Store, making it safe for you to purchase applications and other digital content from the app store.FaceTime for Video CallingMaking FaceTime video calls from your phone to any other Apple iPhone is a breeze with the front-facing FaceTime camera. It lets you keep in touch with your friends and loved ones even if they are miles apart from you.

This next generation iPhone has a remarkably thin and lightweight design and is packed with superior features and high tech apps that enhance the overall Smartphone using experience. This iPhone 5s comes in three beautiful shades, namely, silver, gold and pace grey. Special features include Touch ID that is a fingerprint identity sensor, iSight camera, ultra fast wireless connection, and a better Apple A7 processor that allows the system to run smoother. The high end 8 megapixels along with a 4-inch Retina display, AirPlay media streaming, 4G LTE high-speed data and Siri voice assistant make up the key features of the Apple iPhone 5s.Quality DesignThe fast and sleek iPhone 5s has an aluminium frame which surrounds the 4-inch screen. The iPhone 5s Case is also beautifully designed and made of premium leather. The leather feels soft and luxurious and the microfibre case protects the iPhone.Powerful and fun appsYou get to enjoy an array of iMovie, iphoto, numbers, pages, Keynotes and GarageBand allow you to be creative and showcase your talent from the start. Surfing the web, email, and making FaceTime calls is also easier.More storage spaceThis Apple iPhone contains more storage space with 16GB expandable memory and you get to store and view your favourite music and movies. The advanced audio and video player plays clear and crisp audio and video. The audio and video player support most formats.The excellent battery back up along with the user friendly features and apps make the Apple iPhone 5s a must buy for all iPhone lovers and Apple loyalists.From the ManufacturerApple iPhone 5SThe Apple iPhone 5S takes the cake for being one of the most advanced smartphones of recent times. It features an amazing camera that lets you capture some great pictures and incorporates high-quality and powerful components for a superlative performance. As for the design, it pleases anyone who’s looking for a sleek and stylish phone.Powerful ProcessorThe Apple iPhone 5S is equipped with a powerful A7 processor that is based on the 64-bit architecture. The A7 chip has double the capacity of the A6 chip, which means you will be able to enjoy multimedia games with complete 3D effects. This device also delivers a faster CPU performance and enables you to multitask by launching more than a couple of applications at the same time.Motion Detecting CoprocessorThe iPhone 5S has a motion detecting coprocessor, the M7 coprocessor, that senses motion-oriented data. So when you're consulting Maps while travelling or evaluating your performance on the treadmill with the aid of workout applications, the co-processor automatically starts functioning and takes the load off the main processor. It detects when you park the car and start walking towards your destination and automatically switches from driving to walking while you are navigating. What’s more, the coprocessor recognises if the device has not been picked up for a while and reduces network usage to save on battery.High Resolution TouchscreenThe Apple smartphone features a 4-inch Retina multi-touch screen that gives you an enhanced visual experience. It has a high screen resolution of 1136 x 640 pixels and colour depth of 16M. The contrast ratio of the display is 800:1 and it has an oleophobic coating to withstand fingerprints. These features bring your photos, movies and videos to life and displays them with utmost clarity.Extremely StylishWhat makes this advanced smartphone from Apple distinct from other phones is its precision construction mark in a sleek glass and metal golden colour aluminium casing. A sapphire crystal is fitted on the home button as well as near the iSight camera for protecting it. The sleek and light device measures 7.6mm in thickness and is great for one-handed use. You can choose from stunning shades like gold, silver and space grey.Keep Memories Fresh with iSightThe iPhone 5S comes with two superior cameras. The primary camera with a resolution of 8MP features the iSight technology that enables you to capture crystal clear snaps. Its burst mode feature lets you click 10 snapshots in one second and its sensor is relatively large to allow more light to pass through it. Both the white LED and amber LED deployed in the device, adjust the flash intensity and colour temperature of your picture for optimum results. You can capture panoramic shots and square pictures and even enhance your images with the help of multiple filters available in the phone. It is possible to zoom while recording a video and capture HD videos at the rate of 120 frames per second. Auto image stabilisation is another one of this iPhone’s benefits, which makes sure your images have less noise. This feature also does away with the blurring effect caused due to hand and camera shake.Advanced Security FeaturesThis smartphone has an exclusive fingerprint identity sensor called Touch ID, that can recognize the impression of your fingers when they are placed on the home button. This smartphone by Apple will only unlock when you place your finger on the sensor. This technology ensures that nobody else is able to use the device. In case you want anyone else to have access to the phone, you can easily save their fingerprints on it as well. It is also possible to save your fingerprint as the password for iTunes and Apple App Store, making it safe for you to purchase applications and other digital content from the app store.FaceTime for Video CallingMaking FaceTime video calls from your phone to any other Apple iPhone is a breeze with the front-facing FaceTime camera. It lets you keep in touch with your friends and loved ones even if they are miles apart from you. The webcam of the iPhone 5S has larger pixels as well as a backside illumination sensor so that poor lighting conditions do not deter your web conferencing calls. It is possible to make audio-only FaceTime calls too.Intuitive and User-Friendly OSThe Apple phone in question runs on the iOS 7 operating system, which is so far the most advanced OS offered by Apple. It makes the smartphone very versatile as you can comfortably navigate between applications and download innumerable apps from the Apple App Store. It is designed to go perfectly with the A7 chipset, the new and improved iSight camera as well as the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. It brings an intuitive and user-friendly interface and can be updated to the later versions as soon as they are out.","8MP primary camera with true tone flash, auto focus, geo tagging, face detection burst mode, 1.2MP front facing camera with HD video recording and backside illumination sensor","4-inch multi-touch retina display with 1136 x 640 pixels resolution","iOS 7 operating system with 16GB internal memory","Rechargable battery providing talk-time up to 10 hours on 3G network and standby time up to 250 hours","1 year manufacturer warranty for device and in-box accessories including batteries from the date of purchase","http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BHMTo6nFL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg","http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-WeMC8DFL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg","http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517k18G%2BcnL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg","http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31ygKbef6rL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg","NA","Electronics","Mobiles & Accessories","Smartphones & Basic Mobiles","Smartphones","NA",

High-contrast, dual-domain pixels, and accurate colours ensure that whatever’s on your screen, you’ll love what you see.3D TouchiPhone 6s was designed specifically to work with 3D Touch, the next generation of Multi-Touch. 3D Touch is a revolutionary pressure‑sensing technology that lets you get to the content you want simply by pressing the display. Capacitive sensors measure the pressure you apply on the glass. You instantly see a response on the screen and feel feedback from the all‑new Taptic Engine. 3D Touch is a perfect example of the magic that happens when hardware and software are designed together. 3D Touch can only perform because it was designed alongside iPhone 6s.Touch IDPlace your ﬁnger on the Home button, and just like that your iPhone unlocks.

This level of integration between the A9 chip and iOS 9 means that your iPhone performs better and works more eﬃciently than if we used an off-the-shelf chip that we didn’t design.Your iPhone is beautiful.

In fact, it’s the most popular camera in the world. But what people love even more are the memories that are preserved within those images. Those memories are now incredibly vivid with Live Photos, an entirely new way to bring your still photos to life.Lights. 4K camera. Action.The game-winning shot. The impromptu dance party. The first ride without stabilisers. Some things are meant for video. Now you can record those moments in resolution that’s four times higher than HD video. You can zoom in on those 8 million pixels while you’re shooting or playing your 4K videos.Deeply powerful.The innovation begins from within. At every possible opportunity, iPhone 6s has been engineered to work better. More intuitively.

And the improved Touch ID sensor detects your ﬁngerprint even faster than the previous generation.Software and hardware. A deeper connection.If iPhone 6s seems like it’s tailor‑made for iOS, that’s because it is. Each hardware component — from the A9 chip to the Home button — is designed to get the most out of iOS. And likewise, iOS is designed to maximise the performance and functionality of the hardware it runs on. Together, they deliver a powerful and enjoyable experience because they were designed that way — together.The new standard in phone photography comes as standard.iPhone 6s introduces a next-generation, Apple-designed image signal processor to provide better temporal and spatial noise reduction as well as third-generation local tone mapping. Every pixel in the sensor has been re-engineered to prevent crosstalk between the subpixels, meaning we could fit a lot more pixels in the sensor for a sharper photo that has less noise and truer colour. iPhone 6s features optical image stabilisation for videos in addition to photos, so you can get great shots in low light.","12MP primary camera with auto focus, 4K video recording, flash and 5MP front facing camera","11.4 centimeters (4.7-inch) retina HD 3D-touch capacitive touchscreen with 1334 x 750 pixels resolution and 326 ppi pixel density","IOS v10 operating system with 1.84GHz A9 chip 64-bit architecture processor, 2GB RAM, 32GB internal memory and single nano SIM","1715mAH lithium-ion battery providing talk-time of 14 hours on 3G networks and standby time of 240 hours","1 year manufacturer warranty for device and manufacturer warranty for in-box accessories including batteries from the date of purchase","http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41MAG18py8L._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg","http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41KU1dZBZ1L._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg","http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51StTgPBqfL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg","NA","NA","Electronics","Mobiles & Accessories","Smartphones & Basic Mobiles","Smartphones","NA",

Pushed even further.iPhone 6s Plus - Take everything that made the previous generation great, and advance it to a new level. They’re made with 7000 Series aluminium, the strongest alloy we’ve ever used in an iPhone. They both feature Retina HD displays made from the strongest cover glass used on any smartphone in the world. And now they’re available in an elegant new rose gold ﬁnish.Sleek and seamless, in four gorgeous ﬁnishes.The smooth, continuous unibody design created for iPhone 6 comes to iPhone 6s Plus. Its familiar form feels just right in your hand. And now there are four stunning ﬁnishes to choose from: gold, silver, space grey, and the new rose gold.The world’s strongest smartphone glass. Now even stronger.The new glass on iPhone 6s Plus is made using a special dual ion‑exchange process, which makes it stronger at a molecular level and the most durable in the smartphone industry.7000 Series aluminium. Stronger from the outside in.The iPhone 6s Plus enclosure is made from the same grade used in the aerospace industry. This aluminium is created from a unique composition of elements that make it the strongest alloy we’ve ever used in an iPhone.They come in Perfect sizes. And perfect.iPhone 6s Plus have stunning Retina HD displays. No matter which size you choose, your apps, photos and just about everything else will look vibrant and sharp. High-contrast, dual-domain pixels, and accurate colours ensure that whatever’s on your screen, you’ll love what you see.3D TouchiPhone 6s Plus was designed specifically to work with 3D Touch, the next generation of Multi-Touch. 3D Touch is a revolutionary pressure‑sensing technology that lets you get to the content you want simply by pressing the display. Capacitive sensors measure the pressure you apply on the glass. You instantly see a response on the screen and feel feedback from the all‑new Taptic Engine. 3D Touch is a perfect example of the magic that happens when hardware and software are designed together. 3D Touch can only perform because it was designed alongside iPhone 6s Plus.Touch IDPlace your ﬁnger on the Home button, and just like that your iPhone unlocks. Touch ID is just as secure as before and now works even faster. You can use it within participating apps to sign in and authenticate purchases.A9 chipThe A9 chip is made speciﬁcally for iPhone. By designing our own chip, we can tailor its performance to how people really use their iPhone. So the things you do every day — browsing the web, using apps, taking photos — work even better. This level of integration between the A9 chip and iOS 9 means that your iPhone performs better and works more eﬃciently than if we used an off-the-shelf chip that we didn’t design.Your iPhone is beautiful. Give it a complement.We take great care in designing every aspect of iPhone 6s Plus, including the cases and accessories. Choose a natural leather case in one of ﬁve colours, or go with vibrant silicone in one of 11 colours. And to keep you charged at home, there are now colour‑matched Apple‑designed metal docks.12MP pictures. 4K videos. Live Photos. Lasting memories.People love to take pictures with iPhone. In fact, it’s the most popular camera in the world. But what people love even more are the memories that are preserved within those images. Those memories are now incredibly vivid with Live Photos, an entirely new way to bring your still photos to life.Lights. 4K camera. Action.The game-winning shot. The impromptu dance party. The first ride without stabilisers. Some things are meant for video. Now you can record those moments in resolution that’s four times higher than HD video. You can zoom in on those 8 million pixels while you’re shooting or playing your 4K videos. And with iPhone 6s Plus, optical image stabilisation is now available for videos in addition to photos. So you can shoot smooth, beautiful videos in lower light.Deeply powerful.The innovation begins from within. At every possible opportunity, iPhone 6s Plus has been engineered to work better. More intuitively. And more eﬃciently. iPhone 6s Plus also introduces groundbreaking new technologies, including 3D Touch and Live Photos.64-bit desktop-class architecture.The A9 chip is our third-generation chip with 64-bit architecture. It sits at the cutting edge of mobile chips, improving overall CPU performance by up to 70 per cent compared to the previous generation. And boosting graphics performance by up to a staggering 90 per cent compared to the previous generation.Ultra-fast wireless.Faster Wi‑Fi.iPhone 6s Plus lets you browse the web, download apps and games, and stay connected with the people who matter to you. And with iPhone 6s Plus, you can connect to more networks in more places for even better worldwide roaming. iPhone 6s Plus is also up to twice as fast when you’re connected to Wi‑Fi. And with Bluetooth technology, you’ll stay connected to your Apple Watch, external speakers and hundreds of other devices.*Touch ID. Advanced security.Right at your ﬁngertip.Touch ID lets you unlock your phone simply by using your ﬁngerprint. It uses highly sophisticated algorithms to recognise and securely match your ﬁngerprint. And the improved Touch ID sensor detects your ﬁngerprint even faster than the previous generation.Software and hardware. A deeper connection.If iPhone 6s Plus seems like it’s tailor‑made for iOS, that’s because it is. Each hardware component — from the A9 chip to the Home button — is designed to get the most out of iOS. And likewise, iOS is designed to maximise the performance and functionality of the hardware it runs on. Together, they deliver a powerful and enjoyable experience because they were designed that way — together.The new standard in phone photography comes as standard.iPhone 6s Plus introduces a next-generation, Apple-designed image signal processor to provide better temporal and spatial noise reduction as well as third-generation local tone mapping. Every pixel in the sensor has been re-engineered to prevent crosstalk between the subpixels, meaning we could fit a lot more pixels in the sensor for a sharper photo that has less noise and truer colour. iPhone 6s Plus features optical image stabilisation for videos in addition to photos, so you can get great shots in low light.","12MP primary camera with auto focus, 4K video recording, flash and 5MP front facing camera","13.97 centimeters (5.5-inch) retina HD 3D-touch capacitive touchscreen with 1920 x 1080 pixels resolution and 401 ppi pixel density","IOS v10 operating system with 1.84GHz A9 chip 64-bit architecture processor, 2GB RAM, 32GB internal memory and single nano SIM","2750mAH lithium-ion battery providing talk-time of 24 hours on 3G networks and standby time of 384 hours","1 year manufacturer warranty for device and manufacturer warranty for in-box accessories including batteries from the date of purchase","http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JREwwuinL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg","http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41154ZNb0uL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg","http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519r0QmTeLL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg","http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413ETFW7fmL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg","NA","Electronics","Mobiles & Accessories","Smartphones & Basic Mobiles","Smartphones","NA",

This level of integration between the A9 chip and iOS 9 means that your iPhone performs better and works more eﬃciently than if we used an off-the-shelf chip that we didn’t design.Your iPhone is beautiful. Give it a complement.We take great care in designing every aspect of iPhone 6s Plus, including the cases and accessories. Choose a natural leather case in one of ﬁve colours, or go with vibrant silicone in one of 11 colours. And to keep you charged at home, there are now colour‑matched Apple‑designed metal docks.12MP pictures. 4K videos. Live Photos. Lasting memories.People love to take pictures with iPhone. In fact, it’s the most popular camera in the world. But what people love even more are the memories that are preserved within those images. Those memories are now incredibly vivid with Live Photos, an entirely new way to bring your still photos to life.Lights. 4K camera. Action.The game-winning shot. The impromptu dance party. The first ride without stabilisers. Some things are meant for video. Now you can record those moments in resolution that’s four times higher than HD video. You can zoom in on those 8 million pixels while you’re shooting or playing your 4K videos. And with iPhone 6s Plus, optical image stabilisation is now available for videos in addition to photos. So you can shoot smooth, beautiful videos in lower light.Deeply powerful.The innovation begins from within. At every possible opportunity, iPhone 6s Plus has been engineered to work better. More intuitively. And more eﬃciently. iPhone 6s Plus also introduces groundbreaking new technologies, including 3D Touch and Live Photos.64-bit desktop-class architecture.The A9 chip is our third-generation chip with 64-bit architecture. It sits at the cutting edge of mobile chips, improving overall CPU performance by up to 70 per cent compared to the previous generation. And boosting graphics performance by up to a staggering 90 per cent compared to the previous generation.Ultra-fast wireless.Faster Wi‑Fi.iPhone 6s Plus lets you browse the web, download apps and games, and stay connected with the people who matter to you.

And the improved Touch ID sensor detects your ﬁngerprint even faster than the previous generation.Software and hardware. A deeper connection.If iPhone 6s Plus seems like it’s tailor‑made for iOS, that’s because it is. Each hardware component — from the A9 chip to the Home button — is designed to get the most out of iOS. And likewise, iOS is designed to maximise the performance and functionality of the hardware it runs on. Together, they deliver a powerful and enjoyable experience because they were designed that way — together.The new standard in phone photography comes as standard.iPhone 6s Plus introduces a next-generation, Apple-designed image signal processor to provide better temporal and spatial noise reduction as well as third-generation local tone mapping. Every pixel in the sensor has been re-engineered to prevent crosstalk between the subpixels, meaning we could fit a lot more pixels in the sensor for a sharper photo that has less noise and truer colour. iPhone 6s Plus features optical image stabilisation for videos in addition to photos, so you can get great shots in low light.","12MP primary camera with auto focus, 4K video recording, flash and 5MP front facing camera","5.5-inch (13.97 centimeters) Retina HD 3D-touch capacitive touchscreen with 1920 x 1080 pixels resolution and 401 ppi pixel density","iOS v9 operating system with A9 chip 64-bit architecture processor, 2GB RAM, 16GB internal memory and single nano SIM","Lithium-ion battery providing talk-time of 24 hours on 3G networks and standby time of 384 hours","1 year manufacturer warranty for device and 6 months manufacturer warranty for in-box accessories including batteries from the date of purchase","http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41O1YpRjEKL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg","http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/419LGxeov7L._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg","http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rSUkyV4QL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg","http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41jqMNgg3gL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg","NA","Electronics","Mobiles & Accessories","Smartphones & Basic Mobiles","Smartphones","NA",

Pushed even further.iPhone 6s - Take everything that made the previous generation great, and advance it to a new level. They’re made with 7000 Series aluminium, the strongest alloy we’ve ever used in an iPhone. They both feature Retina HD displays made from the strongest cover glass used on any smartphone in the world. And now they’re available in an elegant new rose gold ﬁnish.Sleek and seamless, in four gorgeous ﬁnishes.The smooth, continuous unibody design created for iPhone 6 comes to iPhone 6s. Its familiar form feels just right in your hand. And now there are four stunning ﬁnishes to choose from: gold, silver, space grey, and the new rose gold.The world’s strongest smartphone glass. Now even stronger.The new glass on iPhone 6s is made using a special dual ion‑exchange process, which makes it stronger at a molecular level and the most durable in the smartphone industry.7000 Series aluminium. Stronger from the outside in.The iPhone 6s enclosure is made from the same grade used in the aerospace industry. This aluminium is created from a unique composition of elements that make it the strongest alloy we’ve ever used in an iPhone.They come in Perfect sizes. And perfect.iPhone 6s have stunning Retina HD displays. No matter which size you choose, your apps, photos and just about everything else will look vibrant and sharp. High-contrast, dual-domain pixels, and accurate colours ensure that whatever’s on your screen, you’ll love what you see.3D TouchiPhone 6s was designed specifically to work with 3D Touch, the next generation of Multi-Touch. 3D Touch is a revolutionary pressure‑sensing technology that lets you get to the content you want simply by pressing the display. Capacitive sensors measure the pressure you apply on the glass. You instantly see a response on the screen and feel feedback from the all‑new Taptic Engine. 3D Touch is a perfect example of the magic that happens when hardware and software are designed together. 3D Touch can only perform because it was designed alongside iPhone 6s.Touch IDPlace your ﬁnger on the Home button, and just like that your iPhone unlocks. Touch ID is just as secure as before and now works even faster. You can use it within participating apps to sign in and authenticate purchases.A9 chipThe A9 chip is made speciﬁcally for iPhone. By designing our own chip, we can tailor its performance to how people really use their iPhone. So the things you do every day — browsing the web, using apps, taking photos — work even better. This level of integration between the A9 chip and iOS 9 means that your iPhone performs better and works more eﬃciently than if we used an off-the-shelf chip that we didn’t design.Your iPhone is beautiful. Give it a complement.We take great care in designing every aspect of iPhone 6s, including the cases and accessories. Choose a natural leather case in one of ﬁve colours, or go with vibrant silicone in one of 11 colours. And to keep you charged at home, there are now colour‑matched Apple‑designed metal docks.12MP pictures. 4K videos. Live Photos. Lasting memories.People love to take pictures with iPhone. In fact, it’s the most popular camera in the world. But what people love even more are the memories that are preserved within those images. Those memories are now incredibly vivid with Live Photos, an entirely new way to bring your still photos to life.Lights. 4K camera. Action.The game-winning shot. The impromptu dance party. The first ride without stabilisers. Some things are meant for video. Now you can record those moments in resolution that’s four times higher than HD video. You can zoom in on those 8 million pixels while you’re shooting or playing your 4K videos.Deeply powerful.The innovation begins from within. At every possible opportunity, iPhone 6s has been engineered to work better. More intuitively. And more eﬃciently. iPhone 6s also introduces groundbreaking new technologies, including 3D Touch and Live Photos.64-bit desktop-class architecture.The A9 chip is our third-generation chip with 64-bit architecture. It sits at the cutting edge of mobile chips, improving overall CPU performance by up to 70 per cent compared to the previous generation. And boosting graphics performance by up to a staggering 90 per cent compared to the previous generation.Ultra-fast wireless.Faster Wi‑Fi.iPhone 6s lets you browse the web, download apps and games, and stay connected with the people who matter to you. And with iPhone 6s, you can connect to more networks in more places for even better worldwide roaming. iPhone 6s is also up to twice as fast when you’re connected to Wi‑Fi. And with Bluetooth technology, you’ll stay connected to your Apple Watch, external speakers and hundreds of other devices.*Touch ID. Advanced security.Right at your ﬁngertip.Touch ID lets you unlock your phone simply by using your ﬁngerprint. It uses highly sophisticated algorithms to recognise and securely match your ﬁngerprint. And the improved Touch ID sensor detects your ﬁngerprint even faster than the previous generation.Software and hardware. A deeper connection.If iPhone 6s seems like it’s tailor‑made for iOS, that’s because it is. Each hardware component — from the A9 chip to the Home button — is designed to get the most out of iOS. And likewise, iOS is designed to maximise the performance and functionality of the hardware it runs on. Together, they deliver a powerful and enjoyable experience because they were designed that way — together.The new standard in phone photography comes as standard.iPhone 6s introduces a next-generation, Apple-designed image signal processor to provide better temporal and spatial noise reduction as well as third-generation local tone mapping. Every pixel in the sensor has been re-engineered to prevent crosstalk between the subpixels, meaning we could fit a lot more pixels in the sensor for a sharper photo that has less noise and truer colour. iPhone 6s features optical image stabilisation for videos in addition to photos, so you can get great shots in low light.","12MP primary camera with auto focus, 4K video recording, flash and 5MP front facing camera","4.7-inch (11.4 centimeters) Retina HD 3D-touch capacitive touchscreen with 1334 x 750 pixels resolution and 326 ppi pixel density","iOS v9 operating system with A9 chip 64-bit architecture processor, 2GB RAM, 128GB internal memory and single nano SIM","Lithium-ion battery providing talk-time of 14 hours on 3G networks and standby time of 240 hours","1 year manufacturer warranty for device and 6 months manufacturer warranty for in-box accessories including batteries from the date of purchase","http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4174qk-98lL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg","http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41HxCUMaROL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg","http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41vME8It%2BSL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg","NA","NA","Electronics","Mobiles & Accessories","Smartphones & Basic Mobiles","Smartphones","NA",

Larger, yet dramatically thinner. More powerful, but remarkably power efficient. With a smooth metal surface that seamlessly meets the new Retina HD display. It’s one continuous form where hardware and software function in perfect unison, creating a new generation of iPhone that’s better by any measure.From the ManufactureriPhone 6 Plus isn’t simply bigger — it’s better in every way. Larger, yet dramatically thinner. More powerful, but remarkably power efficient. With a smooth metal surface that seamlessly meets the new Retina HD display. It’s one continuous form where hardware and software function in perfect unison, creating a new generation of iPhone that’s better by any measure.The biggest iOS release ever.iOS 8 is the world’s most advanced mobile operating system. And with incredible new capabilities and features designed to make the most of a larger display, iOS 8 doesn’t just work seamlessly with iPhone 6 Plus. It makes every experience feel bigger and better.Your wallet. Without the wallet.We completely rethought how you pay to make shopping easy, secure, and private. Apple Pay combines the convenience and security of Touch ID and Passbook with NFC technology. So you can use iPhone 6 Plus to pay in stores and within apps with a single touch.Everything within reach.By creating iPhone 6 Plus and iOS 8 together, we optimized the software to enhance the physical design. iOS swipe gestures were designed to be more fluid across the seamless form, making it easy to navigate iPhone with one hand. With new features like Reachability you can interact with the larger screen in different ways, too. Simply double touch the Home button and the entire screen shifts down closer to your thumb. And to easily navigate Safari or Mail, swipe left to right across the screen to go backward, or swipe right to left to go forward. With the new continuous surface of iPhone, all your gestures now feel smoother than ever.We also thought about how you use your iPhone every day and redesigned the buttons to make it even easier to use. Elongated volume buttons are integrated into the thinner profile, outlined to make them effortless to find by touch. And the Sleep/Wake button has a new home on the side of the device to put it comfortably within reach. The result is an experience that’s even more intuitive.iPhone at its largest. And thinnest.Developing an iPhone with a larger, more advanced display meant pushing the edge of design. From the seamless transition of glass and metal to the streamlined profile, every detail was carefully considered to enhance your experience. So while its display is larger, iPhone 6 Plus feels just right.The camera that changed photos now does the same for video.More people take more photos with iPhone than with any other camera. And now the iSight camera has a new sensor with Focus Pixels and new video features, like 1080p HD at 60 fps, slo-mo at 240 fps, and time-lapse video mode. So you’ll have more reasons to capture more moments on video, too.Hugely powerful. Enormously eﬃcient.Built on 64-bit desktop-class architecture, the new A8 chip delivers more power, even while driving a larger display. The M8 motion coprocessor efficiently gathers data from advanced sensors and a new barometer. And with increased battery life, iPhone 6 Plus lets you do more, for longer than ever.Not just a bigger display. A better display.It’s one thing to make a bigger display. It’s something else entirely to make a bigger Multi Touch display with brilliant colors and higher contrast at even wider viewing angles. But that’s exactly what we did with the new Retina HD display.Security. Right at your fingertip.The breakthrough Touch ID technology lets you securely access your iPhone with the perfect password: your fingerprint. You can also use it to approve purchases from iTunes, iBooks, and the App Store without having to enter your password.Faster wireless.Far and wide.A superfast connection can make you feel like the whole world is within reach. That’s why iPhone 6 Plus has faster LTE download speeds. That’s also why it has more LTE bands than any other smartphone. iPhone 6 Plus supports more advanced wireless technologies to boost performance and help you connect to the things and people that matter most.Higher contrastRather than using traditional methods to create the higher-resolution Retina HD display, we developed an advanced process of photo alignment. This involves using UV light to precisely position the display’s liquid crystals so they lie exactly where they should. Better-aligned crystals deliver a superior viewing experience, with deeper blacks and sharper text.An innovative seamless design.The first thing you notice when you hold iPhone 6 Plus is how great it feels in your hand. The cover glass curves down around the sides to meet the anodized aluminum enclosure in a remarkable, simplified design. There are no distinct edges. No gaps. Just a smooth, seamless bond of metal and glass that feels like one continuous surface.Landscape view on iPhone 6 PlusTo make the most of the even larger display on iPhone 6 Plus, many built-in apps like Mail, Calendar, and Stocks have been redesigned to help you be more productive. Simply switch from portrait to landscape to see some of your favorite apps take on a whole new dimension.","5.5-inch (diagonal) Retina HD display with 1920-by-1080 resolution","A8 chip with M8 motion coprocessor","8-megapixel iSight camera with Focus Pixels, True Tone flash, and optical image stabilization","1080p HD video recording at 60 fps and slo-mo video recording at 240 fps","FaceTime HD camera","http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517hStIPqiL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg","NA","NA","NA","NA","Electronics","Mobiles & Accessories","Smartphones & Basic Mobiles","Smartphones","NA",

In fact, it’s the most popular camera in the world. But what people love even more are the memories that are preserved within those images. Those memories are now incredibly vivid with Live Photos, an entirely new way to bring your still photos to life.Lights. 4K camera. Action.The game-winning shot. The impromptu dance party. The first ride without stabilisers. Some things are meant for video. Now you can record those moments in resolution that’s four times higher than HD video.

High-contrast, dual-domain pixels, and accurate colours ensure that whatever’s on your screen, you’ll love what you see.3D TouchiPhone 6s Plus was designed specifically to work with 3D Touch, the next generation of Multi-Touch. 3D Touch is a revolutionary pressure‑sensing technology that lets you get to the content you want simply by pressing the display. Capacitive sensors measure the pressure you apply on the glass. You instantly see a response on the screen and feel feedback from the all‑new Taptic Engine. 3D Touch is a perfect example of the magic that happens when hardware and software are designed together. 3D Touch can only perform because it was designed alongside iPhone 6s Plus.Touch IDPlace your ﬁnger on the Home button, and just like that your iPhone unlocks. Touch ID is just as secure as before and now works even faster. You can use it within participating apps to sign in and authenticate purchases.A9 chipThe A9 chip is made speciﬁcally for iPhone. By designing our own chip, we can tailor its performance to how people really use their iPhone. So the things you do every day — browsing the web, using apps, taking photos — work even better. This level of integration between the A9 chip and iOS 9 means that your iPhone performs better and works more eﬃciently than if we used an off-the-shelf chip that we didn’t design.Your iPhone is beautiful. Give it a complement.We take great care in designing every aspect of iPhone 6s Plus, including the cases and accessories. Choose a natural leather case in one of ﬁve colours, or go with vibrant silicone in one of 11 colours. And to keep you charged at home, there are now colour‑matched Apple‑designed metal docks.12MP pictures. 4K videos. Live Photos. Lasting memories.People love to take pictures with iPhone. In fact, it’s the most popular camera in the world. But what people love even more are the memories that are preserved within those images. Those memories are now incredibly vivid with Live Photos, an entirely new way to bring your still photos to life.Lights. 4K camera. Action.The game-winning shot. The impromptu dance party. The first ride without stabilisers. Some things are meant for video. Now you can record those moments in resolution that’s four times higher than HD video. You can zoom in on those 8 million pixels while you’re shooting or playing your 4K videos. And with iPhone 6s Plus, optical image stabilisation is now available for videos in addition to photos. So you can shoot smooth, beautiful videos in lower light.Deeply powerful.The innovation begins from within. At every possible opportunity, iPhone 6s Plus has been engineered to work better. More intuitively. And more eﬃciently. iPhone 6s Plus also introduces groundbreaking new technologies, including 3D Touch and Live Photos.64-bit desktop-class architecture.The A9 chip is our third-generation chip with 64-bit architecture. It sits at the cutting edge of mobile chips, improving overall CPU performance by up to 70 per cent compared to the previous generation. And boosting graphics performance by up to a staggering 90 per cent compared to the previous generation.Ultra-fast wireless.Faster Wi‑Fi.iPhone 6s Plus lets you browse the web, download apps and games, and stay connected with the people who matter to you. And with iPhone 6s Plus, you can connect to more networks in more places for even better worldwide roaming. iPhone 6s Plus is also up to twice as fast when you’re connected to Wi‑Fi. And with Bluetooth technology, you’ll stay connected to your Apple Watch, external speakers and hundreds of other devices.*Touch ID. Advanced security.Right at your ﬁngertip.Touch ID lets you unlock your phone simply by using your ﬁngerprint. It uses highly sophisticated algorithms to recognise and securely match your ﬁngerprint. And the improved Touch ID sensor detects your ﬁngerprint even faster than the previous generation.Software and hardware. A deeper connection.If iPhone 6s Plus seems like it’s tailor‑made for iOS, that’s because it is. Each hardware component — from the A9 chip to the Home button — is designed to get the most out of iOS. And likewise, iOS is designed to maximise the performance and functionality of the hardware it runs on. Together, they deliver a powerful and enjoyable experience because they were designed that way — together.The new standard in phone photography comes as standard.iPhone 6s Plus introduces a next-generation, Apple-designed image signal processor to provide better temporal and spatial noise reduction as well as third-generation local tone mapping. Every pixel in the sensor has been re-engineered to prevent crosstalk between the subpixels, meaning we could fit a lot more pixels in the sensor for a sharper photo that has less noise and truer colour. iPhone 6s Plus features optical image stabilisation for videos in addition to photos, so you can get great shots in low light.","12MP primary camera with auto focus, 4K video recording, flash and 5MP front facing camera","13.97 centimeters (5.5-inch) retina HD 3D-touch capacitive touchscreen with 1920 x 1080 pixels resolution and 401 ppi pixel density","IOS v10 operating system with 1.84GHz A9 chip 64-bit architecture processor, 2GB RAM, 32GB internal memory and single nano SIM","2750mAH lithium-ion battery providing talk-time of 24 hours on 3G networks and standby time of 384 hours","1 year manufacturer warranty for device and manufacturer warranty for in-box accessories including batteries from the date of purchase","http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41HK42ZJfuL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg","http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41aWH5NhsVL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg","http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51mI%2Bud3uHL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg","http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41eTO1pHWbL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg","NA","Electronics","Mobiles & Accessories","Smartphones & Basic Mobiles","Smartphones","NA",
